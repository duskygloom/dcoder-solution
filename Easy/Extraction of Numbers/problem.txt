Extraction of Numbers ( 6 XP )

Ron is schizophrenic and sees random digits hidden in words. He thinks it means something and someone is trying to secretly communicate with him. He wants to extract those digits from the words and see if they form a message. Harry really wants to help him but couldn't think of a way.
